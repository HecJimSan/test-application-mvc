TEST-APPLICATION-MVC
===================
* _Description_: The object of this project is to use some functionality through spring mvc and implement it later with reactive project. I would like to compare both.

DEPENDENCIES
===========
- Cucumber
- Wiremock
- Stub-backend (using base project: https://github.com/HecJimSan/stub-backend)

Note: I use this express project in order to mock service. I could have selected wiremock as standalone as well.

- Lombok
- Swagger - http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
